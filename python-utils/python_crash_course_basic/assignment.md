## 1. ‚ú® String Manipulation & Methods

**Task:**  
Write a Python program that takes a sentence as input and:
- Counts the number of words.
- Reverses the order of words.
- Converts the first letter of each word to uppercase.
- Replaces all occurrences of "a" with "@".

**Example Input:**  
`"python is an amazing language"`

**Example Output:**
```python
Word Count: 5
Reversed Sentence: "language amazing an is python"
Title Case: "Python Is An Amazing Language"
Replaced Sentence: "python is @n @m@zing l@ngu@ge"
```

## 2. üöÄ Number Guessing Game (Logical Thinking)

**Task:**  
Create a **number guessing game** where:
- The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.
- The user gets **7 attempts** to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the program should inform the user if the guess is **too high**, **too low**, or **correct**.
- If the user fails in 7 attempts, display the correct number.

**Example Output:**
```
Guess the number (1-100): 50
Too high! Try again.
Guess the number (1-100): 30
Too low! Try again.
...
Correct! You guessed it in 4 attempts.
```

_Hint:_ Use the `random` module.

## 3. üîÑ List Processing & Operations

**Task:**  
Write a program that:
1. Takes a list of numbers as input.
2. Removes duplicates.
3. Sorts the list in ascending order.
4. Finds the maximum and minimum number.
5. Finds the sum of all even numbers.

**Example Input:**
```python
numbers = [5, 3, 8, 3, 10, 2, 8, 5]
```

**Example Output:**
```python
Unique List: [2, 3, 5, 8, 10]
Sorted List: [2, 3, 5, 8, 10]
Max: 10, Min: 2
Sum of Even Numbers: 20
```

## 4. üìú Dictionary Frequency Counter

**Task:**  
Write a program that counts the occurrence of each word in a given string using a dictionary.

**Example Input:**  
`"hello world hello python world"`

**Example Output:**  
```python
{'hello': 2, 'world': 2, 'python': 1}
```

_Hint:_ Use `.split()` and dictionary methods.

---

## 5. ‚ôª Fibonacci Series (Recursion)

**Task:**  
Write a function that prints the **Fibonacci sequence** up to `n` terms.

**Example Input:**  
```python
fibonacci(6)
```

**Example Output:**
```python
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
```

_Hint:_ Use recursion.

---

## 6. üìÉ File Handling Challenge

**Task:**  
1. Ask the user to enter their name and age.
2. Save this information to a text file called `user_data.txt`.
3. Read and display the content of the file.

**Example Interaction:**
```
Enter your name: John Doe
Enter your age: 25
Data saved successfully!

Reading File...
John Doe, Age: 25
```

_Hint:_ Use `open()` with `"w"` and `"r"` modes.

---

## 7. ‚úä Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

**Task:**  
Write a Python program that allows the user to play **Rock, Paper, Scissors** against the computer.

- The user inputs "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
- The computer randomly picks one.
- Display who wins.

**Example Interaction:**
```
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): rock
Computer chose: scissors
You win!
```

_Hint:_ Use the `random.choice()` function.

---

## 8. üóù Palindrome Checker

**Task:**  
Write a program that checks if a given word is a **palindrome** (reads the same forward and backward).

**Example Input:**
```python
is_palindrome("madam")
```

**Example Output:**
```python
True
```

_Hint:_ Use string slicing.

---

## 9. ‚ú® Prime Number Checker

**Task:**  
Write a Python function that checks if a number is **prime**.

**Example Input:**  
```python
is_prime(11)
```

**Example Output:**  
```python
True
```

_Hint:_ A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

---

## 10. ‚è≥ Leap Year Checker

**Task:**  
Write a Python program that determines if a given year is a **leap year**.

**Example Input:**  
```python
is_leap_year(2024)
```

**Example Output:**  
```python
True
```

_Hint:_ A leap year is divisible by **4**, but not by **100** unless also divisible by **400**.

---

## üèÜ Bonus Challenge - Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Write a Python program that allows **two players** to play **Tic-Tac-Toe** in the console. The board should be displayed after every move, and the program should detect when a player wins.
