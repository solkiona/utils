    Abstract Class in Python
    
    ðŸ”¹ Why Use Abstract Classes?
An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is used to enforce a common structure for all its subclasses.

Enforces a Common Interface
An abstract class defines method names and signatures that all subclasses must implement.
This ensures that all child classes follow the same blueprint, making the code consistent and reliable.


what this simply implies is that, for an abstract parent class that contains an abstractmethod, all child classes must implement that abstract method
